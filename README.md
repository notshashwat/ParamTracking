This project is made using the libraries p5.js and poseNet from ml5.js
poseNet is a pretrained model that takes in image of full body of a person and outputs coordinate locations of 17 points of the body and the corresponding confidence scores for each and an overall confidence score.

For the best result ensure good lighting and stand atleast 4-5 feet away with your while body visible to the camera.
